## CLASP - Contrastive Language-Aminoacid Sequence Pretraining

Repository for creating models pretrained on language and aminoacid sequences similar to [ConVIRT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00747), [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/), and [ALIGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05918).

Work in progress - more updates soon!
